# Labor Landmarks: Map & AI Innovation Roadmap

## 📌 Executive Summary
Focusing on technical excellence and intelligence, this roadmap outlines the evolution of the Labor Landmarks platform through advanced geospatial visualization and AI-driven historical analysis.

## �️ Advanced Map Features

### 🟦 Tier 1: Visualization & Interaction
*   **Historical Heatmaps**: Visualize the "density" of labor history. Places like Chicago or NYC glow brighter, helping users find clusters of significance.
*   **Time-Travel Scrubber**: A timeline at the bottom of the map. Slide it to see markers appear/disappear based on their historical date (e.g., "1880-1920").
*   **Neighborhood Zoom Clusters**: Instead of simple dots, use "Spiderification" or "Voronoi" diagrams to expand markers in dense urban areas like the Lower East Side.

### � Tier 2: Geospatial Analysis
*   **Industrial Geo-Layers**: Toggle overlays of "Coal Fields," "Textile Districts," or "Steel Belts" to see how landmarks correlate with industry.
*   **Marker Proximity Linking**: Automatically draw faint connection lines between landmarks that share the same historical union or event (e.g., all "Haymarket Affair" related sites).

## 🤖 AI Features & Intelligent Integration

### 🟦 Tier 1: Concierge & Research
*   **AI Historian Concierge**: A chat interface (building on the existing Concierge WIP) that allows users to ask: "What are the most significant mining-related sites in Pennsylvania?"
*   **Automated Metadata Enrichment**: Use LLMs to scan the existing descriptions and automatically generate tags (e.g., #Anarchism, #ChildLabor, #WomensRights) to improve filtering.

### 🟨 Tier 2: Synthesis & Generation
*   **AI-Driven Event Linking**: An AI that "finds the thread" between geographically distant markers (e.g., "This statue in Boston is linked to this strike in Seattle via this specific organizer").
*   **Archival Text-to-Map**: A tool for admins where they can paste a raw historical article, and the AI extracts coordinates, names, and dates to create a draft landmark.

## � Priority Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Visual Core
*   Implement the **Timeline Scrubber** for temporal filtering.
*   Add **Heatmap Visualization** for macroscopic history views.

### Phase 2: The Intelligent Layer
*   Deploy the **AI Historian Concierge** for natural language exploration.
*   Launch **Auto-Tagging** to clean up and enhance the search experience.

### Phase 3: Spatial Analysis
*   Integrate **Industrial Geo-Layers** and **Marker Proximity Linking**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Map + AI Synergies**: The ultimate goal is an AI that doesn't just chat, but *controls the map*. "Show me every strike in the 30s that involved women workers" should automatically filter the map and move the timeline.
