On November 13, 1909, 259 miners died in the underground Cherry Mine fire. As a result of the disaster, the state established stricter safety regulations and in 1911, the basis for the Illinois Workers Compensation Act was passed. The first monument was erected by the United Mine Workers of America, District No. 12, and dedicated in 1911. The second monument, dedicated in 2009, commemorates the 100th anniversary of the disaster.\nMonument",

    "description": "On October 1, 1851, William Henry, a black cooper, or barrel maker who went by the name of Jerry was arrested in Syracuse, New York. First he was told that he was being arrested for theft. But then he learned that federal marshals had arrested him for violating the Fugitive Slave Law, passed the year before. Jerry had escaped slavery in Missouri. The anti-slavery Liberty Party was holding its convention in nearby church. When word came about Jerry’s arrest, a crowd rushed to release him. Once released he was quickly recaptured and returned to custody. But then a large crowd, numbering more than 2,000 gathered to free Jerry from the office where he was being held. According to research done by the Syracuse University Library, the first person into the office was J. M. Clappe, an iron worker likely chosen for his brawn. The crowd was able to free Jerry and hide him until he could escape into Canada. Clappe also had to flee to Canada to avoid arrest, along with eight others. Nineteen people were indicted for participating in the rescue. Only one person was convicted, and he died before he could appeal. In turn, the abolitionists won an indictment against the marshal who had arrested Jerry. They charged him with kidnapping. Although the marshal was acquitted, it gave the abolitionists a chance to publicly challenge the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Act. Each year until 1858 a Jerry Rescue celebration commemorated the event. Abolitionists referred to the “Jerry Level” as a standard for justice. In 2001 a monument to the rescue was dedicated in Clinton Square, in downtown Syracuse New York. https://laborhistoryin2.podbean.com/e/october-1-the-jerry-level-1601544754?fbclid=IwY2xjawNKCUNleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFrQlR6cUg5dUFUUUFPRnNkAR4lUewojGHeGMAevcOaTvyNqWqcDAS5CoFYhI6MGzDgZw3x8-lYN1IZnglJYg_aem_lC73LpVd5Y4VfE4wXozhmw\nMemorial",

    "description": "The map points out the sites of some key moments in working class history including the 1892 Battle of Homestead, the McKees Rocks Strike, and railroad strike of 1877. The map also includes historically significant locations like the offices of the Abolitionist Newspaper, The Mystery; the homes of August Wilson, Thomas Bell, Jane Grey Swisshelm; as well as monuments to Philip Murray, Fanny Selliins, and Thomas Armstrong and Roberto Clemente.\nSince both the American Federation of Labor (1881) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (1937) were founded in Pittsburgh, the region is seen as the cradle of the American labor movement. However, the story of workers’ aspirations and struggles are not only about the unions and other organizations that represent them. From their formation, social and political forces have shaped Pittsburgh labor unions.\nThis map is based on the book Labor History Sites in the Pittsburgh Region published in 2015 by the Battle of Homestead Foundation and written by Charles McCollester and Howard Scott.\nNOTE: as of 11/2025: \"Right now our link to this map is down. We hope to reconnect soon!\"\nWalking Tour",

    "description": "This collection presents 470 interview excerpts and 3882 photographs from the Working in Paterson Folklife Project of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The four-month study of occupational culture in Paterson, New Jersey, was conducted in 1994. The documentary materials presented in this online collection explore how Paterson's industrial heritage expresses itself in Paterson: in its work sites, work processes, and memories of workers. Included are interpretive essays exploring such topics as work in the African American community, local foodways, the ethnography of a single work place (Watson Machine International), business life along a single street in Paterson (21st Avenue), and narratives told by retired workers.",
