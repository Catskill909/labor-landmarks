    "description": "James Brew was killed on July 12, 1917, during the Bisbee Deportation. The Bisbee Deportation was an illegal act where over 1,000 striking miners and their supporters, many of whom were immigrants, were rounded up by vigilantes and local authorities and deported to New Mexico. During the roundup, Brew fired at a group of men entering his rooming house, killing Deputy Sheriff Orson McRae. Brew was then shot and killed in return fire. A coroner's inquest was inconclusive as to who fired the fatal shots. The incident highlights the tensions surrounding the deportation and the violence that erupted during this dark period in Arizona's labor history.",

The mural has faced challenges over the years. Water damage in 2013 prompted a white stripe of plaster to be added to the wall for stabilization. Despite the efforts, large sections of the damaged area started falling off, posing safety concerns. The mural was vandalized again in 2019",

    "description": "On October 1, 1851, William Henry, a black cooper, or barrel maker who went by the name of Jerry was arrested in Syracuse, New York. First he was told that he was being arrested for theft. But then he learned that federal marshals had arrested him for violating the Fugitive Slave Law, passed the year before. Jerry had escaped slavery in Missouri. The anti-slavery Liberty Party was holding its convention in nearby church. When word came about Jerry’s arrest, a crowd rushed to release him. Once released he was quickly recaptured and returned to custody. But then a large crowd, numbering more than 2,000 gathered to free Jerry from the office where he was being held. According to research done by the Syracuse University Library, the first person into the office was J. M. Clappe, an iron worker likely chosen for his brawn. The crowd was able to free Jerry and hide him until he could escape into Canada. Clappe also had to flee to Canada to avoid arrest, along with eight others. Nineteen people were indicted for participating in the rescue. Only one person was convicted, and he died before he could appeal. In turn, the abolitionists won an indictment against the marshal who had arrested Jerry. They charged him with kidnapping. Although the marshal was acquitted, it gave the abolitionists a chance to publicly challenge the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Act. Each year until 1858 a Jerry Rescue celebration commemorated the event. Abolitionists referred to the “Jerry Level” as a standard for justice. In 2001 a monument to the rescue was dedicated in Clinton Square, in downtown Syracuse New York. https://laborhistoryin2.podbean.com/e/october-1-the-jerry-level-1601544754?fbclid=IwY2xjawNKCUNleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFrQlR6cUg5dUFUUUFPRnNkAR4lUewojGHeGMAevcOaTvyNqWqcDAS5CoFYhI6MGzDgZw3x8-lYN1IZnglJYg_aem_lC73LpVd5Y4VfE4wXozhmw",

The map also includes historically significant locations like the offices of the Abolitionist Newspaper, The Mystery; the homes of August Wilson, Thomas Bell, Jane Grey Swisshelm; as well as monuments to Philip Murray, Fanny Selliins, and Thomas Armstrong and Roberto Clemente.\nSince both the American Federation of Labor (1881) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (1937) were founded in Pittsburgh, the region is seen as the cradle of the American labor movement. However, the story of workers’ aspirations and struggles are not only about the unions and other organizations that represent them. From their formation, social and political forces have shaped Pittsburgh labor unions.\nThis map is based on the book Labor History Sites in the Pittsburgh Region published in 2015 by the Battle of Homestead Foundation and written by Charles McCollester and Howard Scott.\nNOTE: as of 11/2025: \"Right now our link to this map is down. We hope to reconnect soon!\"",

Included are interpretive essays exploring such topics as work in the African American community, local foodways, the ethnography of a single work place (Watson Machine International), business life along a single street in Paterson (21st Avenue), and narratives told by retired workers.",
